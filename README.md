# QuizApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3. This is the frontend of our quiz application. The angular app communicates with two spring boot backend microservices using REST api's. The spring boot backend services are deployed on heroku. Using the frontend, users can create a new quiz to play with their friends. The app also presents results regarding answered questions using chartjs.
